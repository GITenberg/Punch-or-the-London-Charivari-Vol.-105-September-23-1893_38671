<p>Although professional engagements (not wholly unconnected
with the holding of high judicial office in the Tropics) have recently
prevented me from contributing to the paper which specially represents
Bench and Bar, I have never lost sight of the fact that when I
have a duty to perform, the
pages of <i>Punch</i> are open to
me. Under these circumstances
I find myself once
again writing to the familiar
address, and signing myself,
as of yore, with the old name,
and the ancient head-quarters.
I must confess that although
I date this communication
from Pump-Handle Court, I
am, as a matter of fact, staying
at Callerherring, a health
resort greatly patronised by
all patients of that eminent
doctor Sir <span class="sc">Peter Twitwillow</span>.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe
a place so well known to all
lovers of the picturesque. I
may hint that the far-famed
view of twelve Scotch, Irish,
and Welsh counties, and the Channel and the Atlantic Ocean, can
still be enjoyed by those who ascend Mount MacHaggis, and that the
<i>table-d'hôte</i> at the Royal Hibernian Hotel yet costs, with its seven
courses, five-and-sixpence. And now to perform my duty.</p>

<p>My son, <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> (he is christened after some
professional friends of mine, in the hope that at some distant date he
may be assisted by them in the characters of good fairy godfathers
in the profession to which it is hoped he may ornamentally belong),
is extremely partial to sweetstuff. He is a habitual glutton of a
sticky comestible known, I believe, in the confectionery trade as
"Chicago Honey Shells." This toothsome (I have his word for the
appropriateness of the epithet) edible he devours in large quantities,
spending at times as much as five shillings to secure an ample store
of an article of commerce generally bought in quantities estimated
at the usually convenient rate of "two ounces for three halfpence."</p>

<p>It was after a long gastronomic debauch connected with Chicago
Honey Shells that I noticed that <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> was
suffering from a swollen face. My son, although evidently in great
pain, declared that there was nothing the matter with him.
However, as for three successive days he took only two helpings of
meat and refused his pudding, I, in consultation with his mother,
came to the conclusion that it was necessary to seek the advice of a
local medical man. <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> raised objections
to this course, but they were overruled.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, the doctor is not in. He's out for the day."</p>

<p>Such was the answer to my question put twice at the doors of two
medical-looking houses with brass plates to match. On the second
occasion I expressed so much annoyance that the servant quite
sympathised with me.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span> might do, Sir?" suggested the kind-hearted
janitor.</p>

<p>On finding that "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>" was a nephew of the owner of
the house and a qualified medical man, I consented, and "Master
<span class="sc">Sammy</span>" was sent for. There was some little delay in his appearance,
as, although the morning was fairly well advanced, he was not up.
However, after making a possibly hasty toilette, he soon appeared.
No doubt he was much older, but he looked about eighteen. He
was very pleasant, and listened to my history of the case. He
seemed, so it appeared to me, to recognise the Chicago Honey Shells
as old acquaintances. It may have been my fancy, but I think he
smacked his lips when I suggested that <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton
Rollit</span> had probably eaten five shillings' worth at a sitting.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "he has had a bad face ever since; and as our
dentist in town told us about a fortnight ago that sooner or later
he must have a tooth out, I think this must be the one to which he
referred. Won't you see?"</p>

<p>When, after some persuasion, <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> had
been induced to open his mouth, "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>" did see.</p>

<p>"Yes," observed the budding doctor, after he had looked into my
lad's mouth as if it were a sort of curiosity from India that he was
regarding for the first time, "yes, I think it ought to come out."</p>

<p>And armed with this opinion I asked my medical friend if he
knew any one in Callerherring capable of performing the operation.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he replied, after some consideration; "there's a
nice little dentist round the corner. He's called Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span>."</p>

<p>Then "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>" smiled, and I felt sure that he and "the
nice little dentist" must have quite recently been playing marbles
together. Next came the question of the fee. "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>"
was disinclined to accept anything, evidently taking a low estimate
of the value of his professional services. However, he ultimately
said "Three-and-sixpence," and got the money. I would willingly
have increased it to a crown had I not feared that the moment my
back was turned "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>" would have followed the example
of <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span>, and himself indulged in five
shillings' worth of Chicago Honey Shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span> lived in a rather fine-looking house, ornamented
with an aged brass plate, suggesting that he had been established
for very many years. A buttons opened the door, and, on
my inquiring as to whether Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span> was at home,
promptly answered "Yes."</p>

<p>From the venerable appearance of the brass plate I had expected
to see a rather elderly dentist, with possibly white hair and certainly
spectacles; so I was rather taken aback when a dapper young fellow,
who seemed about the age of "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>," entered the
waiting-room. The juvenile new-comer made himself master of the
situation. He seized upon the jaw of poor trembling <span class="sc">George
Lewis Bolton Rollit</span>, and declared that "it must come out."</p>

<p>"He'd better have gas," he observed. "But as I am full of
engagements this morning, you really must let me fix a time."</p>

<p>Then he took out a pocket-book which I could not help noticing
contained such items as "Soda-water&mdash;3<i>s.</i>," "Washing&mdash;5<i>s.</i>," and
"Church collection&mdash;6<i>d.</i>," and placed our name and time amidst the
other entries.</p>

<p>We kept our appointment. The buttons was in a state of excitement.
Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span> received us, and pointed to the gas
apparatus with an air of triumph, as if he had had some difficulty in
getting it entrusted to him in consequence of his youth. Then "Master
<span class="sc">Sammy</span>" made his appearance. He was going to administer the
gas. It was a pleasant family party, and I felt quite parental. Had
it not been for poor <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit's</span> swollen face,
I should have said to Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span>, "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>," my
boy, and the buttons, "Here, lads, let us make a day of it. I will
take you all to Madame <span class="sc">Tussaud's</span> and the Zoological Gardens."</p>

<p>"You have had the gas, haven't you?" said "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>,"
who had been fumbling with the apparatus. "How do you put it
on?"</p>

<p>Poor <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span>, under protest, described
the <i>modus operandi</i>. Then the mouth was opened, and "Master
<span class="sc">Sammy</span>" applied the gas. I am sorry to say he performed the
operation rather clumsily, and my poor lad never "went off."
<span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> subsequently described every detail
of the performance, and said that he had suffered excruciating
pain. Then Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span> went to work, and, after several
struggles, got out a bit of tooth, and then another. Then <span class="sc">George
Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> came to himself, and the usual comforts
were supplied to him.</p>

<p>"I think there's a bit of the tooth still in the gum," said Mr.
<span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span>; and then, after a pause, with the air of Jack
Horner pulling out a plum, he produced an immense pair of forceps
from the instrument drawer. "There." he added, triumphantly, as
he exhibited another piece of ivory, "I told you so!"</p>

<p><span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> had now sufficiently recovered to
complain bitterly of the pain he had suffered.</p>

<p>"Impossible," I observed; "remember this is <i>painless</i> dentistry."</p>

<p>I had not intended the remark as a witticism, but rather as a solace
to the sufferer. Still, "Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>" and Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span>
accepted it as first-class waggery, and indulged in roars of
laughter. Then the former took his departure. I found that I was
indebted to the latter to the extent of 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I don't know how my
dentist had arrived at the sum, but he said it with such determination
that I could only offer a sovereign and receive the change.</p>

<p>"I want my tooth," said <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span>, who
is of an affectionate nature. "I want to give it to Mother."</p>

<p>Then Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span> interposed. He desired to keep the
tooth (in several pieces) himself. I understood him to say that he
regarded it as a memorial of an initial victory&mdash;his first extraction.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" I exclaimed. "Why I thought you had been
established at least twenty years, Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span>."</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth," was the reply, "I am not Mr. <span class="sc">Leo
Armstrong</span>. He's away for the day, and I am taking his place!"</p>

<p>Then <span class="sc">George Lewis Bolton Rollit</span> and I bowed ourselves out. As
I left the premises I fancied I heard the click of marbles. No doubt
"Master <span class="sc">Sammy</span>" and "Mr. <span class="sc">Leo Armstrong</span>" had resumed the
game our visit had interrupted. I was relieved to find myself safe
from a fall caused perchance by one of their runaway hoops.</p>

<p>And now to perform my duty. I need scarcely say that it is to
add my recommendation to that of Sir <span class="sc">Peter Twitwillow</span> anent
Callerherring. You should not fail to visit the place, especially if
you have a son suffering from "a raging tooth," that "must come
out."</p>

<h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="indrl"><span class="sc">Parson and Premier.</span>&mdash;I see that a person who is called "the
Episcopal Vicar of Blairgowrie" said that he would decline to shake
hands with the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>, in the utterly improbable event of
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> wishing to shake hands with <i>him</i>. May I
inquire how there can be a "Vicar of Blairgowrie" at all? Is not
the Established Church in Scotland the Presbyterian one? I know
that they have "Lord Rectors" up north, and so perhaps there are
Rectors as well, but I never heard of a Lord Vicar. "The Lord
Vicar of Blairgowrie" would sound rather well. But what would
his Lord Bishop say? Can any genuine Scotchman kindly assist me
in unravelling this puzzle?&mdash;<span class="sc">Southron Body.</span></p>

<p class="indrl"><span class="sc">Our Auxiliaries.</span>&mdash;When are we likely to have a Minister
of War who will do <i>real justice</i> to Officers of the Volunteers?
I may say that I am thinking of becoming an Officer myself,
and I fancy that the following inducements would be likely
to bring in a fresh supply of these deserving men:&mdash;(1) Exemption
from Taxes. (2) Ditto from Rates, and Serving on
Juries. (3) More gold braid everywhere. (4) A Volunteer Captain
to rank equal to a Lieutenant-General, and a Major of Volunteers
equal to the Commander-in-Chief. (5) Retiring pension, and not less

<h4>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Scene IV.</span>&mdash;<i>An Up-platform at Clapham Junction.</i><br />
<span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Monday afternoon.</i></p>

<p><i>Curphew</i> (<i>to himself, as he paces up and down with a pre-occupied
air</i>). I ought to have been up at the Hilarity rehearsing hours ago.
Considering all that depends on that play of mine&mdash;but there'll
be time enough to pull <i>Flattery</i> together before Saturday. And
this is the only chance I have of seeing <span class="sc">Althea</span> for days. Her
mother hinted last night that she was obliged to let her travel up to
Waterloo alone, and if I <i>did</i> happen to be going up about this time&mdash;and
of course I <i>do</i> happen to be. I <i>must</i> tell <span class="sc">Althea</span>; I can't go on
playing a part any longer. I felt such a humbug last night over
that confounded Eldorado business. But if I'd revealed myself
then as "Walter Wildfire, Comedian and Vocalist," those puritanical
parents of hers would probably have both had a fit on the floor, and
have kicked me out of the house as soon as they were sufficiently recovered!
That's the worst of becoming intimate with a serious
Evangelical family in the character
of a hard-working journalist. I
ought to have undeceived them, I
suppose, but it was such a blessing
to sink the shop&mdash;and besides, I'd
seen <span class="sc">Althea</span>. It would have been
folly to speak until&mdash;but she must
know now, I'll have no more false
pretences. After all, there's no
disgrace in being a music-hall
singer. I've no reason to be
ashamed of the means by which
I've got my reputation. Ah! but
she won't understand that&mdash;the
name will be enough for her! And
I can't blame her if she fails to
see the glory of bringing whisky
and water nightly to the eyes of
an enraptured audience by singing
serio-comic sentiment under
limelight through clouds of tobacco-smoke.
Heaven knows <i>I'm</i> sick
enough of it, and if <i>Flattery</i> only
makes a hit, I'd cut the profession
at once. If I could only hear her
say she&mdash;there she is&mdash;at last&mdash;and
alone, thank goodness! I wish I
didn't feel so nervous&mdash;I'm not
likely to get a better opportunity.
(<i>Aloud, as he meets</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span>.) Mrs.
<span class="sc">Toovey</span> said I might&mdash;can I get
your ticket, or see after your luggage,
or anything?</p>

<p><i>Althea.</i> Oh, thank you, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>,
but <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> is doing all that.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself, his face falling</i>).
That's the maid; then she's
<i>not</i> alone! I must get this over
now, or not at all. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Miss
<span class="sc">Toovey</span>, I&mdash;I've something I particularly
want to say to you; shall
we walk up to the other end of the
platform?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It looks more
serious than ever! Is he going to
give me good advice? It's kind of him to care, but still&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)
Oh, but we shan't have time. See, there's our train coming up now.
Couldn't you say it in the railway carriage?</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>The train runs in.</i></p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). For <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be's</span> edification! No, I don't
quite&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud, desperately.</i>) It&mdash;it's something that concerns&mdash;something
I can't very well say before anyone else&mdash;there'll be
another train directly&mdash;would you mind waiting for it?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It's very mysterious. I <i>should</i> like to know
what it can be! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I hardly know. I think we ought,
perhaps, to&mdash;but this doesn't look a very nice train, does it?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>with conviction</i>). It's a <i>beastly</i> train! One of the very
worst they run, and full of the most objectionable people. It&mdash;it's
quite noted for it.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>, <i>who hurries up with her hand-bag</i>). No, never
mind; I'm not going by this train, <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>; we'll wait for a more
comfortable one.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> Very good, Miss. (<i>To herself, as she retires.</i>) Well, if
that isn't downright barefaced&mdash;I don't know what it is! I hope
they'll find a train to suit 'em before long, and not stay here
picking and choosing all day, or I shan't get back in time to lay the
cloth for dinner. But it's the way with all these quiet ones!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> Did you want to speak to me about last night, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>?
Has my cousin <span class="sc">Charles</span> been getting into any mischief? I only
came in afterwards; but you were looking so shocked about something.
Was it because he had been to a theatre, and do <i>you</i> think
that very wicked of him?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I ought to manage to lead up to it now.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) It was not a theatre exactly&mdash;it was&mdash;well, it was a
music-hall.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> Oh! but is there any difference?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Not much&mdash;between a music-hall and some theatres. At
theatres, you see, they perform a regular play, with a connected plot&mdash;at
least, some of the pieces have a connected plot. At a music-hall
the entertainment is&mdash;er&mdash;varied. Songs, conjuring-tricks,
ventriloquism, and&mdash;and that kind of thing.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> Why, that's just like the Penny Readings at our
Athenæum!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Well, I should hardly have&mdash;but I'm not in a position to
say. (<i>To himself.</i>) I'm further off than ever!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> It couldn't be <i>that</i>, then; for Papa has presided at Penny
Readings himself. But <span class="sc">Charles</span> must have told him <i>something</i> that
upset him, for he came down to
breakfast looking perfectly haggard
this morning. <span class="sc">Charles</span> had a long
talk in the library with him last
night after you left, and then Papa
went to bed.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I felt sure
that fellow spotted me. So he's
let the cat out to old <span class="sc">Toovey</span>! If
I don't tell her now. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Did
Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> seem&mdash;er&mdash;annoyed?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> He looked worried, and I
believe he wanted to consult <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). The deuce
he did! (<i>Aloud.</i>) He mentioned
me?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> He talked of going round
to see you, but Mamma insisted on
his staying quietly indoors.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Sensible
woman, Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>! But I've
no time to lose. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I think
I can explain why he wished to
see me. He has discovered my&mdash;my
secret.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> Have you a secret, Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew</span>? (<i>To herself.</i>) He can't
mean <i>that</i>, and yet&mdash;oh, what <i>am</i>
I to say to him?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> I have. I always intended
to tell him&mdash;but&mdash;but I
wanted you to know it first. And
it was rather difficult to tell. I&mdash;I
risk losing everything by speaking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/136-800.png"><img src="images/136-350.png" width="350" height="482" alt="'He does mean that!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"He <i>does</i> mean that!"</p></div>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He <i>does</i> mean
that! But I won't be proposed to
like this on a railway platform; I
don't believe it's proper; and I
haven't even made up my mind!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) If it was difficult before,
it will be harder than ever now&mdash;just
when another train is coming
in, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>angrily, as the train
passes</i>). Another&mdash;already! The
way they crowd the traffic on this line is simply dis&mdash;&mdash;But it's
an express. It isn't going to stop, I assure you it isn't!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> It <i>has</i> stopped. And we had better get in.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> I don't know if you fancy the look of this train, Miss,
but there's an empty first-class in front.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> This train stops everywhere. We shall get in just as soon
by the next&mdash;sooner in fact.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> If you think so, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, wait for it, but we really
must go. Come, <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> I only took a second for myself, Miss, not knowing you'd
require&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). There's a chance still, if I can get a
carriage to ourselves. (<i>Aloud.</i>) No, Miss <span class="sc">Toovey</span>, you must let me
come with you. Your mother put you under my care, you know.
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>.) Here, give me Miss <span class="sc">Toovey's</span> bag. Now, Miss
<span class="sc">Toovey</span>, this way&mdash;we must look sharp. (<i>He opens the door of an
empty compartment, puts</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>in, hands her the bag, and is
about to follow when he is seized by the arm, and turns to find
himself in the grasp of</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>.) How do you do, Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>?
We&mdash;we are just off, you see.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>). I&mdash;I consider I am very fortunate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
catching you, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>. I accidentally learnt from my wife
that you were going up about this time&mdash;so I hurried down, on the
bare chance of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Yes, yes, but I'm afraid I can't wait now,
Sir. I&mdash;Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> asked me to take care of your daughter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span> will be perfectly safe. And I must have a
few words with you at once on a matter which is pressing, Sir, very
pressing indeed. <span class="sc">Althea</span> will excuse you.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>from the window</i>). Of course. You mustn't think of
coming, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>. <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> will look after me.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> But&mdash;but I have an important engagement in Town
myself!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>unkindly</i>). You will get up quite as soon by the next
train, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, or even sooner&mdash;you said so yourself, you
know! (<i>In an under-tone.</i>) Stay. I'd <i>rather</i> you did&mdash;you can
tell me your&mdash;your secret when I come back.</p>

<p><i>The Guard.</i> Vauxhall and Waterloo only, this train. Stand
back there, please!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He slams the door; the train moves on, leaving</i> <span class="sc">Curphew</span> <i>on
the platform with</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself, bitterly</i>). What luck I have! She's gone
now&mdash;and I haven't told her, after all. And I'm left behind, to
have it out with this old pump! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, Sir, you've something
to say to me?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>nervously</i>). I have&mdash;yes, certainly&mdash;only it&mdash;it's of
rather a private nature, and&mdash;and perhaps we should be freer from
interruption in the waiting-room here.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I wish I'd thought of that myself&mdash;earlier.
Well, he doesn't seem very formidable; it strikes me I shan't find it
difficult to manage him. (<i>Aloud.</i>) The waiting-room, by all
means.</p>

<h3 class="sans">"DUE SOUTH!"</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;When I am travelling due South, as I am now, <i>per</i>
L. &amp; S. W. R., to join my party, all I require may be summed up
in the accompanying "<i>Mem.</i>," which is to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/137-300.png"><img src="images/137-150.png" width="150" height="195" alt="... a good cigar or an old pipe" /></a></div>

<p><i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Give me a Pullman car, my favourite beverage, a good
cigar, or an old pipe charged with well-conditioned bird's-eye, an
amiable companion possessed of sufficient
ready money in small change, give me
likewise a pack of playing cards, let the gods
grant me more than average luck at écarté
or spoof, and never can I regret the two
hours and forty minutes occupied by the
journey from "W't'r'o" to "P'm'th."</p>

<p>To start with, the line to Pinemouth is one
of those "lines" that have "fallen," in the
pleasantest of "pleasant places." On a
broiling summer's day you pass through a
wide expanse of landscape, refreshingly
painted in Nature's brightest water colours&mdash;plenty
of colour, plenty of water. All over the
sandy plains of Aldershot, boxes of toy soldiers, with white toy tents
and the smartest little flags, have been emptied out; and everywhere
about the tiny figures may be seen marching, lounging, digging,
riding, firing, surveying, performing evolutions to the sound of the
warlike trumpet, and generally employed in a sort of undressed
rehearsal of such martial business as is incidental to a Great Campaign
Drama. Then, lest the spirits of the travelling tourist should rise so
high that he might run the chance of "getting a bit above hisself,"
as horse-dealers graphically express it, he is whirled away from the
war-like scene, and is taken through the peaceful grounds of
Wokingham. Here to the unwonted military ardour so recently
aroused in the bosom of the travelling civilian will be administered
a succession of dampers in the shape of attractively-placed and
most legibly printed reminders to the effect that "eligible plots"
for burial are "still to be let," and that the terms for intending
residents in the thriving country town of Necropolis can be obtained
on application to Messrs. Somebody and Sons at Suchandsucher Place,
London; the tone of these notices suggesting, in a generally
festive spirit, that the good old maxim "first come first served"
will be strictly observed in all matters of Necropolitan business.</p>

<p>Then we come to fair Southampton Water, with its marine kind of
flymen waiting to take you to the boats, and the boats waiting to
take you from the flymen to the yachts. On we speed through
the New Forest, where those historically inclined remember
<span class="sc">William Rufus</span>, and others, with a modern political bias, think of
<span class="sc">William Harcourt</span>; while the grateful novel-devourer remembers
that away in the forest resides the authoress of <i>Lady Audley's
Secret</i>, and many other plots. Here, within ten minutes of our
appointed time, is Terminus Number One, East Pinemouth, and,
finally, West Pinemouth, which, speaking for myself individually
and collectively, I prefer to East Pinemouth; at all events, at this
particular time of year. Moreover, it appears that a rapidly increasing
number are of my opinion, seeing how house-building, and
very good house-building, too, is extending westward, and, alas and
alack-a-day, threatening immediate destruction to heather, pine,
fir, and forest generally. I sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"How happy could I be with heather</p>
<p class="i2">If builder were only away!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>No sooner is a house (most of them excellently-planned houses)
set up, with garden and lovely view of sea, than down in front of
him squats another squatter, up goes another house, the situation is
robbed of the charm of privacy, and unless the owner of the first
house sits on his own roof or has a special tower built, which erection
would probably involve him in difficulties with his neighbours,
his view of the sea is reduced to a mere peep, and in course of time
will, it is probable, be altogether blocked out. However, as Boys
will be Boys, so Builders will be Builders.</p>

<p>One of the chief advantages offered by Pinemouth as a place
where a summer holiday may be happily spent, is the facility
afforded for getting away from it, in every possible direction; by
sea, river, rail, and road. <i>À propos</i> of "road," the fly-drivers,
shopkeepers, and livery-stable keepers of P'm'th, are, for the most
part, like the fly-drivers, livery-stablers, and shopkeepers at any
place which boasts a recognised season. The eccentric visitor,
who chooses to come out of the regulation time, must take his
chance, and be content with out-of-season manners to suit his
out-of-season custom; still, in the words of the immortal bard,
"They're all right when you know 'em, <i>but</i> you've got to know
'em fust!"</p>

<p>As to the hiring of flys and midgets, there is a board of rules
and regulations stuck up in the railway station and elsewhere, the
interpretation whereof may possibly be mastered by those able and
willing to devote a few days to the study of its dark sayings.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this rule?" I inadvertently ask a
ruddy-faced policeman, on whose broad shoulders time unoccupied
seems to be weighing somewhat heavily, at the same time pointing
to one of the regulations on the board in question.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," replies the civil constable, in a carefully measured
tone, "it is this way"&mdash;and then he commences.</p>

<p class="center">
*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I breathe again; it is half an hour since I addressed that ruddy-faced
official, from whom, thank goodness, I have at last contrived
to escape. He has kept me there, giving me, as it were, a lecture
on the black board, telling me what this rule might mean if it
were read one way, and what that rule might mean if it were
read another way, and what both rules might mean if they were
each of them read in totally different ways; and how one was
labelled "<i>a</i>" (which I saw for myself), and how another was distinguished
by being lettered "<i>b</i>"; and how he (my constabulary
instructor) "wasn't quite sure himself whether his reading of 'em
was quite right;" then going over all the paragraphs again in
detail, indicating each syllable with his finger, as though he were
teaching an infant spelling-class, and finally coming to the conclusion
whereat <i>Bottom</i> the Weaver arrived when he surmised that it
was all "past the wit of man to understand," and advising me that,
on the whole, if any particular case of attempted extortion should
happen to arise, I should do well <i>not</i> to appeal to these rules and
regulations, but to summon the extortionist before the nearest
police magistrate. "But," said he, as if struck by a new light,
"it may be that this rule '<i>a</i>'"&mdash;&mdash;And here he faced round, in
order more closely to inspect the mysterious cryptogram. Taking
advantage of his eye being off me for one second, which it had
never once been during the previous thirty minutes, I stepped as
lightly and rapidly away as my thirteen stone will permit, and
fled. I fancied I heard him calling after me that he had discovered
something or other; but not even if he had shouted "Stop
thief!" should I have paused in my Mazeppa-like career. "Once
aboard the lugger," I exclaim to myself, quoting the melodramatic
pirate, "and I am free!" So saying, I entered the hospitable
gates of my present tenancy, and sank exhausted on the sofa.</p>

<blockquote><p>
["It would be distinctly an advantage
to girls to serve as clerks in a
lawyer's office before they launched
forth on the world."&mdash;<i>Weekly
Paper.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Edwin</span> was sad indeed, for
all had gone against him. He
had lost everything. Even the
furniture in the house he occupied
was scarcely his&mdash;for all he
knew, at any moment it might
be seized in execution.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" he asked
again, wringing his hands and
tearing his hair.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," was the reply,
spoken in a soft voice and by a
sweet-faced girl. It was <span class="sc">Angelina</span>.</p>

<p>"And you have come to me
in my distress&mdash;after I have
treated you so badly?" he said,
with a flush of shame colouring
his hitherto pale face.</p>

<p>"No, darling," returned the
golden-haired maiden, looking
into his brown eyes with optics
of an azure hue. "Do not say
that you have behaved badly
to me. You wrong yourself;
you do, indeed."</p>

<p>"Have I not deserted you?"
he asked in a tone of bitter
sorrow.</p>

<p>"But only after you had
written me letters upon which
I could base an action for
breach of promise," murmured
the forgiving girl.</p>

<p>"But do you propose to
proceed upon them?" he asked
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Yes, my own. To quote
that touching song you so frequently
sang to me in the gilded
days of the golden past, 'it will
be the best for you and best
for me.' I shall certainly ask
for substantial damages."</p>

<p>"And is there no way to avoid
this crushing, this final disaster?"
asked the young man,
in deep distress.</p>

<p>"Dearest, you know that I
have studied the law. Well, I
would propose that you should
carry out your contract. I have
here the form which requires
but the registrar's signature to
make us man and wife. What
do you say to the matter being
settled to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"If it must be so, it must,"
returned <span class="sc">Edwin</span>, in a tone of resignation.
"And now, as we
are to be married to-morrow,
let us dine together. I have an
invitation from my aunt at
Putney to stay with her until
my goods have been seized and
sold. I am off. She will extend
to you her hospitality."</p>

<p>"Oh, my betrothed, I cannot
come." she sobbed. "I am kept
here by duty."</p>

<p>"Well, as you will," he replied,
carelessly. "But I suppose
we meet at noon at the
registrar's to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for by that time all
will be over. The goods will
be removed, and I shall be free&mdash;free
to become your wife."</p>

<p>"But what have you got to do
with my property?"</p>

<p>Then came the sorrowful admission.</p>

<p>"Oh, <span class="sc">Edwin</span>, my own. You
know I am in a lawyer's office.
For the moment I am their
guardian. Yes, darling, I am
the woman in possession!"</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, September 11.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Alpheus
Cleophas</span> walking about the
Lobby with a new foot-rule obtrusively
held in his hand. Thought at first he was
going to probe somebody, after the fashion
of <span class="sc">Swift MacNeill</span>, in rare access of
ferocity.</p>

<p>"No," he said, when I asked him if that
was his business; "we are presently going to
debate question of appointment of Duke of
<span class="sc">Connaught</span> to command at Aldershot. I
want to know precisely how far out of the
line of fighting the Duke was at Tel-el-Kebir.
You know <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman's</span>
suave manner. When I put question to him,
he'll say, 'How can I tell the Hon. Member,
not having a foot rule in my pocket.' As
soon as he says that, I whip this out; he will
sit confounded, and either we shall get at
the truth of a matter with which country is
deeply concerned, or <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>
must go. I have no personal interest in
such a contingency. If there were a vacancy
at the War Office, it is, of course, quite possible
that Mr. G. might think of me. I fancy
in Committee on the Army Estimates I have
shown I know a thing or two. But that is
neither here nor there. It will be time to
decide on the offer when it is made, if indeed
prejudices, from which even Liberal Ministry
are not free, do not stand in the way. At
present I want to know, within a foot or two&mdash;no
one can say I'm unreasonable&mdash;how far
off the fighting the Duke of <span class="sc">Connaught</span> stood, and <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>

<p>Turned out that <span class="sc">Alpheus</span> did not find opportunity of bringing in
the foot measure. <span class="sc">Dalziel</span> raised question Appointment of Royal
Duke to command at Aldershot; a ticklish
subject for young Member to take up.
<span class="sc">Dalziel's</span> manner
excellent; gave tone to debate, happily
preserved throughout; several times
<span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>
brought out foot-rule and shook it at
<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>.
War Minister, naturally well
up in strategy, had observed
precaution of placing on his
flank his Financial Secretary,
<span class="sc">Woodall</span>, V.C. If there
was any probing to be done
that veteran would receive
first onslaught. Thus assured, <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span> made admirable
defence of a position held in advance to be shaky. Came
out of Division Lobby with flying colours and majority of 117.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Army Votes in Committee of Supply.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Lords met to-day&mdash;at least Lord
<span class="sc">Denman</span> and the Bishop of <span class="sc">Ely</span> did. They, facing each other from
either side of otherwise empty chamber, heard Royal assent given
to number of bills, and House adjourned for seven days. Don't
know what we should have done this week in Lords but for <span class="sc">Denman</span>.
Everyone else gone out of town. He still treads the burning
deck, his plum-hued skull-cap giving touch of chastened colour to
passages leading to and from the House. Severe taste might object
that it is a little painful in conjunction with the brilliant red of the
leather-covered benches. But whoever responsible for selection of
that decoration should have thought of <span class="sc">Denman's</span> skull-cap. He
was here yesterday; did quite a lot of business; moved Second
Reading of his Woman's Suffrage Bill.</p>

<p>"My Lords," he said, rising from the seat which the burly figure
of the <span class="sc">Markiss</span> usually fills, "I think there is an opportunity of
making substantial progress with this important measure. If your
Lordships will be so good as to suspend the Standing Orders, as has
just been done in case of Naval Defence Amendment Bill, we could
carry the measure through all the stages before your Lordships
rise."</p>

<p>For all answer <span class="sc">Kensington</span>, on Woolsack in absence of <span class="sc">Lord
Chancellor</span> pacing the battlements of his lordly castle at Deal, put
the question that the Bill be read a second time; declared in same
breath "the Not-Contents have it;" and so <span class="sc">Denman</span> and his little
Bill contemptuously swept aside.</p>

<p>"I thought better of them, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said, when I met him an
hour later still hovering round the closed doors of the House.
Over his arm was his rusty old coat; in one hand a stick; in the
other a hat that had seen silkier days. There was a tear in his
eye, and a tremor in his still musical voice. "It seemed as if a
better day had dawned; and that the House of Lords was about
at last to recognise in me the worthy son of a father once their
pride. Last week the change suddenly came. It was <span class="sc">Denman</span> this
and <span class="sc">Denman</span> that, and 'we must see what we can do about your
Suffrage Bill.' The <span class="sc">Markiss</span> going to his seat on Wednesday gave
me a friendly nod and smile. Usually he never sees me except when
I get on my legs, when he forthwith moves the Adjournment of
House. As for the Whips, I fancied they must have been looking
up my speeches in <i>Hansard</i>, and learned what they had lost by not
being in their place to hear them. 'I trust your lordship is well,
and do not find the electric light too glaring?' 'You must take a
place by the table so that you can hear <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> and <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>.'
'We shan't keep you up late on Friday; have arranged to take
Division at midnight so that you may get home in good time. But
you'll be there, of course?'"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/144-2-600.png"><img src="images/144-2-200.png" width="200" height="325" alt="'It was Denman this, and Denman that.'" /></a>
"It was Denman this, and Denman that."</div>

<p>"And were you there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I was there, and voted in majority against Home-Rule
Bill. Came down yesterday prepared to make most of this
new and pleasant turn. Got up to ask <span class="sc">Kimberley</span> question as
to whether postponement of Home-Rule
Bill would date from Friday or Saturday.
Nice point, you know. Everything depends
upon it. No one had discovered point but
me. Expected Government and House
would be grateful. What happened?
<span class="sc">Kimberley</span> snubbed me; House sniggered;
my Woman's Suffrage Bill, about which
Opposition Whips so anxious last week,
treated with usual contumely. I propose
to deal with Coal Strike; they move
the Adjournment, and leave me speechless at
the table. Begin to think that all they
wanted was my vote to swell majority
against Home-Rule Bill. A weary world,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>. Saddest of all
for neglected statesmen in our gilded Chamber. Should you
ever be made a peer take an old man's advice
and do everything you can to obscure your native abilities. Once
you excite the jealousy of men like the <span class="sc">Markiss</span>, and implant in their
bosom suspicion that if they don't look out you may supplant them,
you are lost. Perhaps I made a mistake when I admitted <span class="sc">Farmer-Atkinson</span>
to my councils. You remember him in the other House
as Member for Boston? We had a plan&mdash;&mdash;but no matter.
Still, if <span class="sc">Farmer-Atkinson</span> had led the Commons and I the Lords,
you would have seen something. Perhaps we were too reckless in
our open colloguing in the Lobby. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> smelt a rat. <span class="sc">Salisbury</span>
saw it moving in the air; the instincts of self-preservation
triumphed over political animosity and the rivalry of a lifetime.
They put their heads together; the coffers of the secret-service
money were depleted; the illimitable resources of the State were in
other ways drawn upon. Where is <span class="sc">Farmer-Atkinson</span> now? I am
left solitary and friendless. For a while the Unholy Alliance
triumphs; but they will find they have not done with <span class="sc">Denman</span> yet."</p>

<p>The old gentleman took off his skull-cap; carefully wrapped it up;
hid its plumage in his tail-pocket; and pressing his hat over his
brow, shook his grey head, and walked wearily down the corridor.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House of Lords adjourned for a week.</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 2.40 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;"Who goes home?" I hear the cry resounding
through the Lobby. Well, if no one minds, I think I
will. Been here since half-past three yesterday. For the matter of
that, been here since the 31st of January. Coming down again at
noon to sit till <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> can see his prospect clear to
bringing about Adjournment next Saturday.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
